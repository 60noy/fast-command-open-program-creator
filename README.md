# fast-shortcut-shell-command
A script I created which enables fast program executing in terminal

I created this script after realising I repeat the same steps over and over again 
for every program I download on Linux.

What does this program do?
* Creates a copy of the program's folder in ~/bin named *script_name*_dir - the script_name is dynamic
* Creates a script in ~/bin which executes the program in the directory
* Gives access to the script so it could be executed everywhere form the terminal
